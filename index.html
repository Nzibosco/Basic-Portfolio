        <p> My name is Bosco. I like playing games on my PC. It makes me feel I am on top of the world!
       I am learning how to make fun games to help people have fun too. The world has become 
            crazy and chaotic! We need some free time to play.</p>
        <p>In the end, that is what makes life more fullfilling. Not boring! Finally, I like to wish people joy and success. It makes me happy when y'all happy.</p> 
        <p id="quote">This is my awesome quote from Stewart B. Johnston: "Our business in life is not to get ahead of others but to get ahead of ourselves-to break our own records, <br> to outstrip our yesterdays by our today, to do our work with more force than ever before."</p>

        <p>This quote from Steve Jobs also resonate with me very well: “One way to remember who you are is to remember who your heroes are.”
                “If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to say, “Bye. I have to go. I’m going crazy and I’m getting out of here.” And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently. (Steve Jobs)”
            That is exactly the kind of mentality I have, when CSS tries to mess up with me! </p>
